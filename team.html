    <p class = "text-center"> Greetings to whomever is perusing this site. My name is Nicola Frachesen, and I am currently a third year Digital Arts and Sciences major at the University of Florida. This is quite the varied major, and thus, for clarification, my main area of interest is User Experience design for software applications, as functional design is something which really interests me. Whether it be for video games, mobile applications, or other such things, I like figuring out what makes things fun and easy to use. When not trying to get through the myriad programming and art classes I'm taking for my major, I quite enjoy reading, writing, and playing video games, among other things. I'm also fluent in English and French, and am pretty familiar with Japanese, Java, and C++. I've never had to create a presentation as long, interesting, and detailed as this one before, but, given my experience with public speaking, I believe it will be a fun and interesting experience.

      Hello! My name’s Richard, first-generation Chinese-American, native Floridian, University of Florida student, third-year computer science major, self-appointed friend, programmer, and social mammal. I understand that that’s quite a long name, so I just go by Richard. You would likely find me in one of three places: in class, in front of my computer(s), and in the land of dreams. In the empty spaces between those three, I’m all over the place, so no promises. I am a pop music lover, a listener, a joker, and above all things a runner - both physically and philosophically. Feet to the pavement, eyes to the horizon: it is only there where we will find the future.
    </p>
    <p class = "text-center">
      Besides those quaint little notions, I am a student programmer of various small-scale applications, eagerly looking for opportunities to get involved in larger projects.I am a programmer by trade, gamer by heart, jack-of-all-trades as necessitated by responsibility. My interest (at least, one of them) is in reading and writing stories, but not necessarily in words: video games are a great and relevant example. I have spent more than enough of my past time on this earth lost in other developers’ crafted worlds; it is only appropriate that in the future I should try to create my own worlds for the next generation of dreamers to lose themselves in.
    </p>
    <p class = "text-center">
      But… things can change. In the end, all I am is a wee baby in this world made of cogs, which would keep on turning whether or not I helped to make it so. For the record, I do intend to help. I’m just not sure how to, yet. Working on it!

        <p class="text-center"> Hi, My name is Natalie Rumak! I am a junior in the Digital Arts and Sciences major at the University of Florida with an interest in studio art and math. In the future, I  hope to work in game development as part of the art team. I want to bring games to life by providing interesting and unique 3D character models.  My two siblings and I were born and raised in Clearwater, FL. My parents moved here before we were born and are both originally from Poland, so all my extended family lives in Europe. I spent most of my childhood summers visiting family and traveling around Europe. Traveling is a big part of who I am and I hope to continue visiting new places in the future. My main hobby is digital painting. I started around 2 years ago and have improved dramatically since then. If I’m not painting, I will be researching new techniques or keeping up with the social media sites where I upload my paintings.
